# UNP_PROJECT_WITH_PYTHON
Completed during my Python (Machine Learning) internship with United Network of Professionals (UNP).

**Objective**: To develop a machine learning model to predict student salaries, aiding career planning and decision-making.

**Topics Covered**:  
1. Dataset Exploration: Analyzing and understanding the data structure.  
2. Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and encoding data, handling missing values.  
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing relationships and correlations.  
4. Machine Learning Models: Applying Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Tree, and Random Forest.  
5. Model Evaluation: Comparing model performance based on accuracy.  
6. Model Optimization: Enhancing model predictions for better accuracy.  
7. Final Model Selection: Choosing the best-performing model (Random Forest).

**Key Steps**:  
- Processed a dataset with 34 variables and 2,998 records.  
- Cleaned and encoded data (e.g., Gender, Degree).  
- Performed exploratory data analysis.  
- Applied Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Tree, and Random Forest; Random Forest had the highest accuracy.
